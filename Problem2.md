### Problem 2 - Median of Two Sorted Arrays (20 points)

+ Given two sorted arrays $A$ and $B$ of sizes $n$ and $m$ respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. If there are two medians return the average of them. 
+ **5pts.** Implement a brute-force solution as `getMedianBrute()` method in [src/Problem2.java](src/Problem2.java). 
+ **5pts.** Implement a divide-and-conquer efficient solution as `getMedianSmart()` method in [src/Problem2.java](src/Problem2.java).
+ **5pts.** Describe in written form your solution ideas in the **Report** section below.
+ **5pts.** Defend your solutions to your instructor in live during practice sessions.
+ Your code will be tested against various inputs using `JUnit6` testing framework.
+ **Don't change API** of the solutions in [src/Problem2.java](src/Problem2.java).

#### Example 1
+ Input: `A={2,4}, B={3}`
+ Output: `3.0`

#### Example 2
+ Input: `A={2,4}, B={3,5}`
+ Output: `3.5`

#### Constraints
+ $0 \leq n,m \leq 1000$
+ $1 \leq (n+m) \leq 2000$
+ $-10^6 \leq A[i],B[i] \leq 10^6$
+ $A$ and $B$ are sorted in non-descending order

### Report - Median of Two Sorted Arrays
**Brute-force.** Merge both arrays into one sorted array and take the middle element (or average of two middle). $T(n+m)=\Theta(n+m)$.

**Divide-and-conquer.** Find the k-th element of two sorted arrays. Compare A[k/2] and B[k/2], the smaller one's first k/2 elements can't contain the k-th, so throw them away and decrease k. $T(k)=T(k/2)+O(1)$, so $T=\Theta(\log{(n+m)})$.

**Time (n = m = 1000, ns per call):** brute ~9490, smart ~293.

### Defense Interview 
+ Be ready to justify running times, for example using **Master method** for divide-and-conquer algorithms.
+ Be ready to answer questions on algorithms and your code.
+ Be ready to run your code and test it on various inputs.

Good Luck!
